# About this repository

I enrolled in a Udemy Full Stack Web Dev course in August 2022, as I feel interested in building web applications and being able to offer more help to my team during Hackathons. As of September 2022, I am still learning the front-end section of the Udemy course; where currently I can use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to an intermediate level; while for the backend, I am quite experienced in C++ and Python, and understood the fundamentals of APIs & Command line instructions. I am actively learning react right now, and will upload more projects in the upcoming weeks.

**Please have a look at the Responsive CSS Site! I spent a lot of time building it & writing its README :D**
