# About this repository

I enrolled in a Udemy Full Stack Web Dev course in August 2022, as I feel interested in building web applications and being able to offer more help to my team during Hackathons. As of September 2022, I am still learning the front-end section of the Udemy course; where currently I can use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to an intermediate level; while for the backend, I am quite experienced in C++ and Python, and understood the fundamentals of APIs & Command line instructions. Recently I haven't dedicated a lot of time to building projects due to year 11 yearlies and the upcoming HSC exam for my accelerated subject, but I am actively learning new content from the course every day and building small projects to improve my skills. I will finalise these projects and upload them once the exam is over :)

**Please have a look at the Responsive CSS Site! I spent a lot of time building it & writing its README :D**
